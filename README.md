## Installation and Usage

- **Create an Engagement** - Click the engagement dropdown in the top-right and give your engagement a name
- **Pick a Module** - Choose from Passive Recon, Active Recon, Vuln Scanning, etc.
- **Configure & Run** - Select a tool, set your target, and hit run
- **View Results** - Output streams in real-time; files are saved and tracked per engagement
- **Use Presets** - Save your favorite tool combinations as one-click presets

### Prerequisites

**To run the app:**

- Windows 10/11 with WSL 2 installed

**To build from source:**

- Node.js 18+
- Rust toolchain

## What is this?

NetView gives you a single, clean interface to run all your favorite security tools. No more switching between terminals. No more losing track of which scan finished. Just point-and-click simplicity with all the power underneath.

It runs on **Windows** (using WSL for the Linux tools) and is built with Tauri + React - so it's fast, lightweight, and actually looks good (Linux soon).

## ⚠️ Heads Up

This is for authorized security testing only. Don't be that person. Always get permission before testing systems you don't own.
